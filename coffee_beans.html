      <h1><b>Learn more about the world of coffee!</b></h1>
      <p>
        No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are
        many legends about its origin. Coffee grown worldwide can trace its
        heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian
        plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the
        potential of these beloved beans. The story goes that that Kaldi
        discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a
        certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to
        sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local
        monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him
        alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
        discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the
        energizing berries began to spread. As word moved east and coffee
        reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring
        these beans across the globe.
      </p>
      <h1>Coffee Beginnings</h1>
      <p>
        The history of coffee is rich with legend and intrigue. Coffee has grown
        to be one of the world’s most traded agricultural commodities and is a
        favorite beverage, celebrated and enjoyed across cultures and
        continents. And it all began long ago, circa AD 800–900, with an
        Ethiopian goat herder, Kaldi, who noticed his goats became energetic
        after eating berries of a certain shrub. Curious, he tried one himself
        and noticed it had a similar effect. A monk who came across Kaldi and
        his dancing goats grew intrigued and picked some berries from the same
        shrub. He crushed them into a powder and added boiling water (this may
        have been the first-ever cup of coffee). Upon tasting the concoction and
        realizing it released energy, he rushed back to his monastery to share
        his findings. The monks hailed the discovery as a “gift from the Lord,”
        for now they would be able to stay awake during their long prayers.
        Starbucks became part of coffee’s rich history in 1971, opening its
        first store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market.
      </p>
      <h1><u>Coffee Brands Used :</u></h1>
      <h2>1. Stumptown Coffee Roasters</h2>
      <p>
        Among a list that includes coffee producers which have been in business
        for a hundred years or more, giving the top position to a relatively new
        roaster might seem outrageous. However, Stumptown's coffees are
        outrageously good. Since opening in the 1990s, Stumptown has slowly
        percolated into a superior position in the world of coffee, boiling into
        the crème de la crème of caffeine companies. Through a dedication to
        coffee science, and careful consideration of the product they source,
        Stumptown offers beans that encompass the complexity of what coffee
        really is. They do so in an approachable way, encouraging a learning
        experience with each cup. Their bagged offerings are some of the higher
        priced choices on this list, so purchasing one is more of a splurge than
        it is an everyday habit. Still, having Stumptown coffee stored and on
        hand for special occasions or a slow weekend morning can change the way
        you see and taste coffee. These beans are that good.
      </p>

      <h2>2.Intelligentsia</h2>
      <p>
        Intelligentsia calls themselves the world's best coffee, and they aren't
        far off the mark. This brand might be better labeled as the world's
        smartest coffee. In many circumstances, Intelligentsia has put the
        lion's share of focus on plant genetics. By ensuring that their coffee
        can be directly traced or is a relation of a coffee that hails from
        Ethiopia's "primal coffee forests," Intelligentsia is priming their
        roasts to have a specific profile. They aim for fruit-forward varieties,
        and though the logo is a star, there isn't any wishing on a celestial
        body here. This coffee is a sure thing. With some specialty brands
        offering high quality at a high value, you might not get into the habit
        of drinking Intelligentsia every day. A bag of it can run a pretty
        penny, but it is worth the money to have on the days when you deserve an
        especially good cup. True to form, the roasts have fruitier profiles.
        The D.R. Congo Muungano is a good example. As a single origin hailing
        from the shores of Lake Kivu in Eastern Congo, it leaves the taste buds
        tingling with bright bursts of honey, nectarine, and cherry. There are
        opposing blends as well, such as the El Gallo, which is prominent in
        chords of milk chocolate and cherry cola. When it comes to
        Intelligentsia, there is a lush jungle of flavors to enter
      </p>

      <h2>3. Lavazza</h2>
      <p>
        Starbucks may be the biggest backers of espresso in America, but never
        forget that the origin of this coffee making technique comes from Italy.
        If you ever need a reminder, pull a bag of Lavazza from your store
        shelves. From the first scoop of grounds to your final mug, this brand
        of beans will take your morning redeyes and turn them into a leisurely
        flight to the world's cappuccino capital. Lavazza coffees are known for
        their intensity, and each roast comes clearly labeled with where it sits
        on the scale. The Classico is a coveted roast, but it is the Gran
        Selezione that holds the crown. The chocolate-forward accent makes it a
        morning cup to savor slowly. It may be 7 on the intensity scale, but it
        is a 10 of 10 in terms of taste. Other blends can come in lower
        intensities but still pack as much flavor as a true espresso. (And if
        you decide to spring for a home espresso machine, take heart: Despite
        what you might expect, a daily espresso actually has less caffeine and
        lower acidity than a daily coffee.)
      </p>

      <h2>4. Caribou Coffee</h2>
      <p>
        Caribou Coffee began as a small roastery and shop in the far-off land of
        Minnesota, but these days their cafes and bagged beans can be found in
        just about every state. There isn't much to mention about Caribou in
        terms of their process or company values; they are Rainforest Alliance
        Certified but don't have an Equal Exchange-like focus on sustainability,
        the coffee is fresh, but not process-driven like Peet's. Whatever they
        are doing up there works. This is one stellar cup of coffee. Caribou's
        motto is explanatory: "Life is Short. Stay Awake For It." Their product
        offerings match the catchphrase. Caribou java is strong enough to pull a
        sleigh and served with a striking taste. The highlight of their bagged
        offerings are dark roasts like the Mahogany Blend, which has a loamy
        profile that eases you right into the demands of the day. Lighter
        selections have bright pops of tangy flavors. No matter which one you go
        with, your taste buds will take off like a team of reindeer.
      </p>

      <h2>5. illy Coffee</h2>
      <p>
        When you think of quality espresso, it's hard not to let your mind drift
        towards a daydream of an idyllic Italian scene. Your kitchen may not
        look like a gleaming Sicilian villa or a bustling cafe on the streets of
        Rome, but illy Coffee can make it smell like one. The city of Turin
        often gets most of the love for birthing the now-international Lavazza
        brand, but there is another place that has long been a crucial part of
        the Mediterranean nation's coffee history. The far northeastern city of
        Trieste is as true a coffee capital as there has ever been. The king of
        the capital? illycaffè. To be fair, illy comes at a fairly high price
        point for grocery store coffee. It also comes with an incredibly fine
        flavor. The 8.8-ounch tins come packed with one of Italy's finest
        roasts, including pods for your single-cup machine and some of the best
        instant coffees under the Tuscan sun (and anywhere else). illy is often
        used as an espresso coffee, but the magic of it is that — whether from
        your French press or regular coffee maker — it tastes smooth and
        balanced rather than burnt or sour. Even so, there is a Ground Drip
        Classico in case you don't believe it. Getting your toes wet is an
        Italian tradition after all.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Starbucks</h2>
      <p>
        Decades of expansion across the American coffee landscape has proved
        Starbucks as more than just a passing fad. Before it was known as the
        place to get sugary, limited-time novelty beverages, Starbucks was
        introducing traditional espresso-based drinks to a country that was
        largely unfamiliar with the taste. These days, it's likely that you
        associate the company with trendy, flamboyant offerings, but the café
        chain has stuck true to the roots of roasting a simple but great cup of
        joe. Research on American coffee habits by Yahoo! Finance suggests that
        most java drinkers prefer to sip on a standard cup of coffee rather than
        espresso beverages. Starbucks rose to prominence by offering a darker,
        heavier brew, but fortunately that doesn't translate to burnt flavors.
        The signature Pike Place roast meets caffeine-heads where they're at. It
        is a potent cup that has an accent of toasted nuts. Plus, a bag of
        Starbucks beans is definitely more approachable than a Unicorn
        Frappuccino.
      </p>
      <h2>7. Peet's Coffee</h2>
      <p>
        The legacy of Peet's Coffee goes far beyond their own company. As The
        Seattle Times reports, Dutch immigrant Alfred Peet, the founder of this
        self-named coffee company, actually inspired Starbucks and provided the
        first roasted beans that the shop would use at their Pike's Place store.
        Peet's dedication to overseeing the manual roasting process of his
        namesake beans can still be tasted today. A mug of Peet's coffee will
        take you back to a time before convenience and quick-service ruled
        everything. Similar to Café Bustelo, Peet's puts an emphasis on locking
        in freshness during the post-roast process by sealing their bags
        immediately. The care that is involved in this process allows both
        blends and single origin beans to fully display their flavors with every
        swig. Peet's does come at a slightly higher price point, but it is good
        enough to save you money by turning your kitchen into your new favorite
        café.

      <h2>8. Kahawa 1893</h2>
      <p>
        Chances are that when you head out to shop at Trader Joe's, you already
        know a lot of what's going to be dropping in your cart. The Triple
        Ginger Snaps, Two-Buck Chuck — some items are mandatory pickups! This is
        why a trip into TJ's feels more like comfort shopping than the adventure
        that it could be. It's tough to find new things when there are so many
        reliable and exclusive products. However, one new addition to the
        shelves that can't be missed on your next grocery run is Kahawa 1893. It
        is a premium African coffee brand that sources directly from farmers on
        the African continent. Kahawa means coffee in Swahili, but for founder
        Margaret Nyamumbo the brand also means returning to a family business.
        Kahawa 1893 sources beans directly from women farmers in Kenya and
        Rwanda. You might say that each bean was raised with a mother's love
        because regardless of whether or not these female farmers have children,
        they are nurturing the delicious crop that becomes your daily cuppa. In
        this way, love and appreciation for the art of growing coffee can be
        tasted in every bag. And, beans taste better when you know they are
        serving a good cause. The mission is amazing, and the coffee will be a
        highlight of your week. If you're feeling dicey, try the Roaster's
        Choice (though there isn't much risk involved — it's still top-notch).
      </p>
      <h2>9. Equal Exchange</h2>
      <p>
        Equal Exchange coffees are one of the few where quality and value can be
        seen in more than just the end product and price tag. The mass coffee
        industry is rife with exploitation, but Equal Exchange, which also
        offers chocolate and tea, evens the playing field by focusing on fair,
        alternative trade practices that uplift marginalized groups. The result
        is a bag of beans that you can trust in a multitude of ways: Equal
        Exchange matches your eco-ethics, generates justice for those slighted
        by the coffee world, and tastes amazing. The best word to describe this
        brand is smooth. From the first mouthful to the last, their coffee is
        delightfully palatable. In particular, the Women in Coffee series, which
        highlights female-led coffee operations in the Equal Exchange supply
        chain, presents two different blends which are each a revelation of
        slightly sweet, brown-sugar-noted beans. Equal Exchange should have
        little competition for your morning cup.
