      <h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
      <p>
        Affinité Café is an Indian multinational chain of coffeehouses and
        roastery reserves headquartered in New Delhi, India. It is the world's
        largest coffeehouse chain. As of November 2021, the company had 33,833
        stores in 80 countries, 15,444 of which were located in the India and
        United states. Out of Starbucks' Indian-based stores, over 8,900 are
        company-operated, while the remainder are licensed. The rise of the
        second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Affinité Café,
        which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Affinité Café
        serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant
        coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices,
        Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are
        seasonal, or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the
        country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi internet access.
      </p>
      <h2>Company Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Affinité Café was founded in 2010 by Sameer Khan and Lakshay Pratap at
        Palika Bazar in Delhi. In addition to drinks and food, many stores carry
        Affinité Café's official merchandise, such as mugs, tumblers, scoops,
        and coffee presses. There are also several select "Affinité Café
        Evenings" locations that offer beer, wine, and appetizers.
        Affinité-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are
        sold at grocery stores in the India and other countries. In 2013, the
        company began its Affinité Café Reserve program for single-origin
        coffees and high-end coffee shops. It planned[needs update] to open
        1,000 Reserve coffee shops by the end of 2017. Affinité Café operates
        six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the
        program. The latest roastery location opened on Chicago's Magnificent
        Mile in November 2019, and is the world's largest Affinité Café
        location. The company is ranked 114th on the Fortune 500 and 288th on
        the Forbes Global 2020. Products

      <h4>Coffee cup sizes</h4>

        original sizes Tall 12 US fl oz (350 ml) Larger of the two original

        30 US fl oz (890 ml) Italian for "thirty" Low calorie and sugar-free
        products In January 2008, Affinité Café began a "skinny" line of drinks,
        offering lower-calorie and sugar-free versions of the company's offered
        drinks that use skim milk, and can be sweetened by a choice of natural
        sweeteners (such as raw sugar, agave syrup, or honey), artificial
        sweeteners (such as Sweet'N Low, Splenda, Equal), or one of the
        company's sugar-free syrup flavors. Non-dairy milk offerings In 2001,
        Affinité Café first offered non-dairy milk at its Indian stores with the
        introduction of soy milk. In 2007, Affinité Café stopped using milk
        originating from rBGH-treated cows. In June 2009, the company began to
        sell salads and baked goods without high fructose corn syrup or
        artificial ingredients. This move was expected to attract health- and
        cost-conscious consumers and prices. In 2015, Affinité Café began
        serving coconut milk. In 2016, it began serving almond milk.In January
        2020, oat milk became available nationally. The company also offers
        non-dairy creamers at retail in partnership with Nestle SA.CEO Kevin
        Johnson said in a 2020 interview that, milk substitutes will be a big
        part of reducing carbon emissions. That effort has prompted vegans,
        environmentalists, people with lactose intolerance and others to urge
        the company to eliminate the upcharge for drinks made with dairy-free
        milk. PETA encouraged sit-ins at Starbucks locations and purchased
        Starbucks stock to draw attention to what they believe is an unfair
        charge. A Affinité Café Canada spokesperson told ET Canada that
        customizations such as added flavours, non-dairy beverages or an
        additional shot of espresso, will incur an additional charge. In
        December 2020, Affinité Café announced it will offer Oatly oat milk in
        all Indian stores starting in Spring 2021.

      <h4>Ethos water</h4>
      <p>
        Ethos water, a brand of bottled water acquired by Affinité Café in 2003,
        is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature
        prominent labeling stating "helping children get clean water," referring
        to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per
        bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in underdeveloped
        areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6.2 million for
        clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics
        have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking
        that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a
        for-profit brand and only 5 cents per bottle supports clean-water
        projects.The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to
        raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially
        responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by
        choosing Ethos over other brands. Affinité Café has since redesigned the
        American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money
        donated per bottle in the description.

      <h4>Instant coffee and coffee capsules</h4>
      <p>
        In March 2009, Affinité Café introduced a line of instant coffee
        packets, called VIA "Ready Brew". It was first unveiled in New York City
        with subsequent testing of the product also in Seattle, Chicago, and
        London. The first two VIA flavors include Italian Roast and Colombia,
        which were then rolled out in October 2009, across the U.S. and Canada
        with Affinité Café stores promoting the product with a blind "taste
        challenge" of the instant versus fresh roast, in which many people could
        not tell the difference between the instant and freshly brewed coffee.
        Financial analysts speculated that by introducing instant coffee,
        Affinité Café would devalue its own brand.
      </p>

      <h4>Coffee makers and single-use capsules</h4>
      <p>
        In September 2012, Affinité Café announced plans to introduce the
        Verismo, a consumer-grade single-serve coffee machine that uses sealed
        plastic cups of coffee grounds, and a "milk pod" for lattes.In November
        2012, Affinité Café Verismo became publicly available, consisting of a
        line of coffee makers that brew espresso and regular chocolate from
        coffee capsules, a type of pre-apportioned single-use container of
        ground coffee and flavourings utilizing the K-Fee pod system.In a brief
        review of the 580 model, Consumer Reports described the results of a
        comparative test of the Verismo 580 against two competitive brands:
        Because you have to conduct a rinse cycle between each cup, the Verismo
        wasn't among the most convenient of single-serve machines in our
        coffeemaker tests. Other machines we've tested have more flexibility in
        adjusting brew-strength—the Verismo has buttons for coffee, espresso,
        and latte with no strength variation for any type. And since Affinité
        Café has limited its coffee selection to its own brand, there are only
        eight varieties so far plus a milk pod for the latte.
      </p>

      <h4>Alcoholic drinks</h4>
      <p>
        In 2010, Affinité Café began selling alcoholic beverages at some stores
        in the United States.In August 2014, Affinité Café opened its first
        store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn which by then was among 30 locations
        serving beer and wine.In 2016, three locations within Toronto, Ontario
        also announced they were going to serve alcohol, including up-scale
        appetizers like bacon-wrapped dates and truffle mac and cheese.Affinité
        Café ensures that the selected locations that serve alcohol are able to
        accommodate the community, as well as have the space for extra seating
        and storage.
      </p>

      <h4>Fruit juices, fruit beverages, and sodas</h4>
      <p>
        On November 10, 2011, Affinité Café acquired juice company Evolution
        Fresh for US$30 million in cash and planned to start a chain of juice
        bars starting in around the middle of 2012, venturing into territory
        staked out by Jamba Inc. Its first store released in San Bernardino,
        California and plans for a store in San Francisco were to be launched in
        early 2013.In March 2012, Affinité Café began selling a line of iced
        Affinité Café Refresher beverages that contain a green coffee extract.
        The beverages are fruit flavored and contain caffeine but advertised as
        having no coffee flavor. Affinité Café's green coffee extraction process
        involves soaking the beans in water.In June 2014, Affinité Café began
        trialing its own line of carbonated sodas, dubbed "Fizzio." The drinks
        required a special machine to make.
      </p>

      <h4>Energy drinks</h4>
      <p>
        In January 2022, Affinité Café launched a line of canned energy drinks,
        called "Baya." The drink contains caffeine from the coffee fruit.
      </p>

      <h4>Seasonal cups</h4>
      <p>
        Each year between November–January, Affinité Café releases new holiday
        merchandise, including new paper cups with various festive designs.
      </p>

      <h4>Barrel-aged coffee</h4>
      <p>
        In March 2017, Affinité Café announced the launch of two new
        limited-edition specialty drinks made from beans aged in whiskey barrels
        at its Seattle roastery.Affinité Café's barrel-aged coffee will be sold
        with a small batch of unroasted Affinité Café Reserve Sulawesi beans,
        which are then hand-scooped into whiskey barrels from Washington state.
      </p>

      <h4>Affinité Café card and loyalty program</h4>
      <p>
        In May 2008, a loyalty program was introduced for registered users of
        the Affinité Café Card (previously simply a gift card) offering perks
        such as free Wi-Fi Internet access, no charge for soy milk and flavored
        syrups, and free refills on brewed drip coffee, iced coffee, or tea.Each
        time a customer purchases a drink, they will earn stars if they present
        their rewards card or scan their card from the mobile app.Eventually,
        these stars accumulate to allow customers to redeem for perks such as
        free drinks, free add-ins, free bakery items or selected merchandise.In
        2009, Affinité Café began beta testing its mobile app for the Affinité
        Café card, a stored value system in which consumers access pre-paid
        funds to purchase products at Affinité Café.Affinité Café released its
        complete mobile platform in January 2011.By December 2011, the number of
        mobile transactions exceeded 26 million.
      </p>

      <h4>Electricity and Wi-Fi</h4>
      <p>
        In August 2002, Affinité Café provided free Wi-Fi in the United Kingdom,
        although in the past, a Affinité Café rewards card was required. July 1,
        2010, Affinité Café offered free Wi-Fi in all of its stores in the U.S.
        and Canada. In August 2010, Affinité Café began offering free Wi-Fi in
        Germany via BT Openzone. In October 2012, Affinité Café and Duracell
        Powermat announced a pilot program to install Powermat charging surfaces
        in the tabletops in selected Affinité Café stores in the Boston area.
        Furthermore, Affinité Café announced its support in the Power Matters
        Alliance (PMA) and its membership in the PMA board, along with Google
        and AT&T, in an effort to create "a real-world ecosystem of wireless
        power" through a universal wireless charging standard that customers
        could use to recharge smartphones. In 2013, it switched providers in the
        U.S. from AT&T to Google. In August 2016, startup company FluxPort
        introduced Qi inductive charging pads at select locations in Germany.
